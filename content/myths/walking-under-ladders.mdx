# Walking Under Ladders: When Superstition Meets Safety

## The Myth

Walking under a ladder is believed to bring seven years of bad luck in many Western cultures. This superstition has led generations of people to go out of their way to avoid passing beneath ladders.

## The Reality (Partial Truth)

This is one of the rare superstitions that has a **practical basis in safety**, though the supernatural aspects remain unfounded. While walking under ladders won't bring mystical bad luck, it can certainly increase your risk of injury.

## Historical Origins

### Ancient Symbolism
- **Egyptian Beliefs**: Ladders represented the journey between earth and heaven
- **Christian Symbolism**: The Holy Trinity was represented by the triangular space beneath a ladder
- **Medieval Times**: Breaking the triangle was considered sacrilegious

### Practical Evolution
Over time, the superstition likely evolved from **real safety concerns** mixed with religious symbolism.

## The Safety Reality
